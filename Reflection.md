## Reflection on Building a Calculator in Swift

Building the calculator in Swift was a fairly straightforward experience, with the main challenge being adapting familiar programming principles to a new language. Having a background in Java gave me with a strong foundation, but Swift has its own unique syntax, type safety features, and operator handling that required a change in approach. For example, Swift’s use of readLine() for input felt more streamlined than Java’s Scanner, but it needed custom validation to enforce proper handling of user input. Designing inline prompts and integrating seamless error handling was a challenge, but it provided much needed insights into Swift’s control flow and error management. This also drove home the importance of creating user-friendly interactions, even for a simple application. I liked Swift’s concise and expressive syntax, as it gave a more clean and efficient coding experience compared to Java’s verbose style. This project served as a good introduction to Swift, using foundational programming concepts to 
be translated across languages with their own adjustments.
